# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will add comprehensive multi-language support to the BetterGenshinImpact WPF application. The system will provide localized UI text for different languages, with language files stored separately for easy translation management, and automatic detection of available language files to populate language selection options.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to switch the application interface to my preferred language, so that I can use the application more comfortably in my native language.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user opens the language settings THEN the system SHALL display all available languages detected from language files
2. WHEN the user selects a different language THEN the system SHALL immediately update all UI text to the selected language
3. WHEN the user restarts the application THEN the system SHALL remember and apply the previously selected language
4. IF no language preference is saved THEN the system SHALL use the system default language or fallback to English

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a translator, I want language files to be stored separately from the application code, so that I can easily translate the application without modifying source code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN language files are created THEN they SHALL be stored in a dedicated language resources directory
2. WHEN a translator adds a new language file THEN the system SHALL automatically detect and include it in available language options
3. WHEN language files are modified THEN the changes SHALL be reflected in the UI without requiring application recompilation
4. IF a translation key is missing in a language file THEN the system SHALL fallback to the default language or display the key name

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the localization system to automatically discover available languages, so that adding new languages doesn't require code changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL scan the language directory for available language files
2. WHEN a new language file is added to the directory THEN the system SHALL automatically include it in the language selection dropdown
3. WHEN language files follow the naming convention THEN the system SHALL correctly identify the language code and display name
4. IF language files are malformed or missing THEN the system SHALL log errors and continue with available languages

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want all UI elements to be properly localized, so that the entire application interface is consistent in my chosen language.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a language is selected THEN all static text elements SHALL be translated
2. WHEN a language is selected THEN all button labels, menu items, and tooltips SHALL be translated
3. WHEN a language is selected THEN all error messages and notifications SHALL be translated
4. WHEN a language is selected THEN all dialog boxes and popup messages SHALL be translated
5. IF dynamic content contains translatable text THEN it SHALL also be localized appropriately

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a centralized localization system that integrates well with WPF data binding, so that implementing translations is straightforward and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing localization THEN the system SHALL support WPF data binding for automatic UI updates
2. WHEN text needs to be localized THEN developers SHALL use a simple markup extension or binding syntax
3. WHEN the language changes THEN all bound UI elements SHALL automatically update without manual refresh
4. WHEN adding new translatable text THEN the process SHALL be consistent and well-documented
